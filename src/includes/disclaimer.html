                            <p>In Inclusiville, we have sought to emulate how users of screen readers experience a website. This exercise, however, is not a perfect representation, nor could it be.</p>
                            <p>A computer generated voice unlocking a page one line at a time, dependent upon the accessibility of the website (or lack thereof), and the frustrations that can ensue are only for those reliant on screen readers to truly know. We urge everyone to consider that each person's lived experience is unique, and that is no less true of people who are blind or visually impaired.</p>
                            <p>Remember, once you've met one blind person, you've met one blind person. So while our simulation does not exactly mimic any of the commercially available screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, or VoiceOver, we do hope that you leave with a broader perspective, some metaphorical swag from The Empaths, and <em>a desire to make the world a more accessible and inclusive place for all</em>!</p>
                            <p><strong>Inclusiville does not claim to be an accurate representation of screen reader behaviours. Install a screen reader application such as JAWS or NVDA and try it yourself for a true experience.</strong></p>
